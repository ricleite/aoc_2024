```
$ grep -r -i "disgusting" src/
src/day_13p2/prog.rs:        // disgusting one-liner
src/day_17p2/prog.rs:    // another few disgusting one-liners
src/day_04p1/prog.rs:    // also disgusting
src/day_04p1/prog.rs:                    // these casts are disgusting
src/day_04p2/prog.rs:    // also disgusting
src/day_04p2/prog.rs:                    // these casts are disgusting
src/day_24p1/prog.rs:    // disgusting, but does the trick
src/day_13p1/prog.rs:        // disgusting one-liner
src/day_24p2/prog.rs:    // disgusting, but does the trick
src/day_02p2/prog.rs:    // this is absolutely disgusting
src/day_17p1/prog.rs:    // another few disgusting one-liners
```
